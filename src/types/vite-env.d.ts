// This file enables TypeScript to understand Vite's environment variables and runtime features.
// It imports type definitions from Vite's client, making `import.meta.env` and other Vite globals type-safe.
// Only one such file is needed in your project.
// Note: currently this place not used, but it is a good practice to have it for type safety and IDE support.
