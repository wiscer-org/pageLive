# PageLive: Future Development

This document outlines planned and future features for the PageLive project. These features are not yet implemented but are under consideration or in the roadmap for future releases.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (Planned)

- A customizable system of **context-aware keyboard shortcuts**, tailored to each supported site or context.
- Allows navigation to specific areas, triggering announcements, or performing page-specific actions (e.g., “Jump to last message”, “Open reply box”).
- Includes shortcut conflict detection and per-site enable/disable options.
- Will support shortcut configuration in future settings UI.

## Options UI (Planned)

- Lets users customize:
  - Page rules and selectors
  - Announcement style and method
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Per-site enable/disable toggles

## Vision

PageLive is built to **bridge the gap between screen readers and dynamic web apps**. It gives blind and low-vision users a smart assistant that **brings content to them**, instead of making them search for it. In the future, PageLive will offer full keyboard control to complement that smart awareness — making modern web experiences faster, easier, and more empowering.
