# About the `docs/org` Folder

This folder contains all organizational and non-software information or data related to the PageLive project. As PageLive aims to secure funding in the future, it is important to establish or affiliate with a non-profit organization.

## Organizational Legitimacy Options

Below are possible pathways for PageLive to achieve organizational legitimacy:

- Fiscal sponsorship by an established non-profit.
- Collaboration with other non-profit organizations.
- Establishing an independent non-profit entity.

## Potential Grant Sources

- Google's charitable programs focused on accessibility.
- Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation "Seed Innovation Grants": funding for pilot projects or early-stage non-profit initiatives.
